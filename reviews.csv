JBL Tune 215BT,"Ich finde die Verarbeitung Top. Funtionen gehen gut. Ich habe keine Ohrenschmerzen nach mehrern Stunden und die Hörer sitzen gut. Mit Dolby atmos hören sich die Bässe für mich bessser an. Sehr klarer Klang. Die Bässe kommen schlecht zur Geltung. Für die Größe und Preis ist es aber Top. Stimmen sind richtig gut, also für Buch Audio oder Podcast perfekt.
Das Band vom tragen her sitzt gut. Nichts Rutscht oder raschelt.

Vom Umfeld bekomme ich Persöhnlich zu viel mit (Störgeräusche). Da es nicht tief im Gehörgang sitzt war es für mich zu erwarten.

Wer Bass Musik oder Rock hört ist vielleicht nicht mit den Bass zufrieden. Dolby Atmos hilft, aber spürbar."
JBL Tune 215BT,Klinken mooi maar na nu twee jaar met af en toe gebruiken zit er een draad breuk in.
JBL Tune 215BT,"Qualidade sonora de equipamentos de valor superior, acabamento muito bom."
JBL Tune 215BT,"Estou satisfeito com a qualidade geral. Aqui estão os prós e contras que observei:

Prós:

Qualidade do som: O som é claro e bem equilibrado, com graves decentes para um modelo nessa faixa de preço.

Conforto: O design é leve e se ajusta bem ao redor do pescoço, sendo confortável para uso prolongado.

Bateria: A duração da bateria é boa, aguentando várias horas de uso antes de precisar recarregar.

Fácil de usar: Os botões de controle são intuitivos e fáceis de acessar, permitindo ajustar o volume ou pausar a música sem problemas.

Contras:

Isolamento de som: Não bloqueia completamente os ruídos externos, então pode não ser ideal para quem busca isolamento total.

No geral, é uma ótima opção para quem quer um fone de ouvido básico e funcional por um preço acessível. Recomendo para quem procura algo simples e eficiente."
JBL Tune 215BT,"Perfect Sound and Bass, and it is very light-weight too. Cord is a little bit narrow, not enough strong. The main problem I am facing with this neckband is the absence of magnetic closure, it 's loosely hang on the neck without our control, and everytime we have to press ON to connect and OFF to disconnect."
JBL Tune 215BT,"Resolution for my problem - Amazon is trying to tell me that 'even if you're unable to use the earphones, still keep that Rs. 1600 of earphones with you but we'll not take it back. So what if your money goes in vain, none of our business.' Never expected anything like this with Amazon atleast. I would recommend to go and buy from the shop because Amazon is also not selling it in any lesser price, moreover, you can bargain for it with the shopkeepers and check it according to your satisfaction then and there.

Issue in wearing the earphones - Basically, I'm facing an issue with the fitting of the earpieces and if I'm forcing it into my ears, it's hurting. So wanted to return the earphone and talked to 2 of the Amazon CCE and tried hard to make them understand my problem million times but they're keep on repeating about their policy that it doesn't allow us to initiate a return, if there would've any technical issue then it could've been replaced but either way return is not possible. After requesting for really long she said, ""I'm trying to initiate a return for your product but it's showing some error and the system is saying, there's no technical issues in the product"".. like how did your system got to know that the product is not having any technical issues when I didn't shared any photos or videos with Amazon. Seriously? Is this how your system works? Also the CCE said, ""earphones cannot be returned, so keep it with you or talk to the JBL"", So now I have to keep this Rs. 1600 earphones with me as a showpiece because neither I can use it properly nor I can give it to any of my family members as they too are unable to use it because of the fitting problem.

Earphones - It has a quiet good audio but I didn't find it that much reliable for calls because I was having trouble listening to the other side person's voice and they're also facing issue listening to me when I keep my head straight and not very close to the mic.
Google assistance - Well, it's working quiet good with my Redmi Note 8 Pro but doesn't connect with the Google assistant, although I'm still trying to figure out how to connect with Google assistant.
Battery - It took me around 1 hour 15 mins for fully charged from 0% to 100% and when it came to me, it has 50% charging which gone dead after almost 7 hours of use."
JBL Tune 215BT,"Highly Recommended! Over the past 2 years, I have bought 6 pairs of these JBL Tune 215BT earphones, for myself & my family members. They are a perfect workhorse earphones for both work & play. They are such a great deal, that I buy backup pairs just in case they run out of stock. I hope JBL does not stop the production of these amazing buds at this attractive price point.

I've used many earphones (both wired, wireless neckband, wireless TWS) including Sony, JBL, Sennheiser, Panasonic, Apple, Samsung Galaxy Buds, OnePlus Bullets & Oppo Enco etc. However, the JBL Tune 215 BT are my default earphones. Here's why:

1. For regular use, I prefer open ear design (a la original Apple earphones) rather than in-ear silicon tips. This helps me listen to my own voice better when speaking on calls. It also lets in a little outside noise, so that I'm not completely cut off from external stimuli (Eg: Ringing doorbell, public announcements in metro etc.)
2. Good Sound Quality with decent bass. Not too over-powering like some of those cheap Chinese brands. Mids & treble are fine too, with a typical warm audio signature.
3. Non-rigid neckband style unlike OnePlus Bullet series, so it remains more discreet and is barely noticable when not being used.
4. I also prefer neckband over TWS, as you can simply unplug them and let it lay on your neck rather than carefully place both TWS stems back in their case. In short, the neckband design is more suited for everyday rough & tough use without worrying about misplacing them.
5. Multi-point connectivity between 2 devices simultaneously. A premium feature that lets the earphones be connected to 2 devices at the same time. Extremely helpful for working people (connected to laptop & phone at the same time). Can also be used if you have 2 mobile phones, or a mobile phone and a tablet. For example, if you are watching a video on a laptop, but then got a call on your phone, you will be alerted and can seamlessly answer the call.
6. Decent Battery Life.
7. The buttons on a neckband are more useful & convenient than those on TWS due to the nature of their design. In the end, a proper pushy button will always be more intuitive than touch / tap gestures on TWS stems. This is an important feature for me as I have disabled Absolute Bluetooth volume in my Windows PC, so I need to have separate volume controls for any BT audio that I use.
8. Good mic. Again the placement of the mic in neckband style design, means it is much closer to your mouth and will be able to capture your voice much clearer than TWS style stems, which are close to your ears. This is especially true in less than ideal conditions (wind noise, external disturbances etc.) and has helped me a lot in online meetings. In general, a neckand gives you the best of both worlds. The better reliability of old-school wired earphones as well as the move-freely handiness of BlueTooth technology.
9. Very durable. I bought my 1st pair in 2021. After nearly 2 years, in 2023, I finally ""retired"" them and moved on to my 2nd pair. Although the audio was perfectly fine, the rubber eartips had worn out after 2 years of use & were peeling away. This reduced the ear canal seal thereby reducing the bass effect. Hence, I finally decided to ""retire"" them & write this review as an appreciation of thanks to JBL! :)"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Me ha gustado la calidad de sonido, la duración de la bateria, la adaptación a mis oidos y la facilidad y rapidez de conexión con los dispositivos. No tengo ningún elemento negativo que destacar."
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery. Sound and noise cancelation better than previous model. Ear tips smaller and lighter, for me hold really good even running, better bass and treble."
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.

Connectivity & Ease of Use:

Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.

Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:

Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.

That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.

Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:

Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.

Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:

I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.

Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:

Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.

App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:

Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.

Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.

Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:

Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.

If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point."
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass."
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good. The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes."
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"I love these headphones! They used to be my daily until I started wearing a bud type one, but I still wear these at night. I listen to books or podcasts as I fall asleep and I don't lose them because they're around my neck (and no, I haven't even felt like I have been at risk to be strangled! Haha) they are comfortable and great sounding, and love that the magnetic closure stops the music. They're easy to connect to other devices and turn on and off. I've now bought 3 pairs (because I sleep in them, the cord gets shorted out)but I'm sure if I didn't they'd have lasted me even longer. Hope I never have to find another pair of headphones like this!"
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"La puntualidad, presentación me gustó muchísimo"
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"Nice earphones, my third set of wireless buds and this version has more bass. Battery lasts along time and very quick to charge. I wear these more than my xm5's"
Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"I have used it for couple of hours and I can say it's real good. Thing is i used to use OnePlus bullets wireless z2, but they stopped working two weeks back. I was about to buy them again because those were beauties but then i saw a news about this thing coming on 12, I am not a fan of realme but i thought why not give them a try, I bought them as soon as they went live and got them today. Here are my initial impressions.

Sound (5/5)- Sound is Very rich and clear you can clearly hear all the notes and the bass is real good too, I think it's par with my oneplus if not better, the spatial audio makes it even better but that could be personal preference. They support dolby atmos, they have inbuilt equalizer support (with app), gaming mode, volume enhancer, dynamic bass and spatial audio. So they have covered almost every aspect.

Size (3/5) - Size it too big if I compare it with oneplus and you can feel them hanging on your neck, could have been compact.

Call (5/5) - So far I have received couple of call and they work fine almost as good as oneplus bullets wireless z2 and those were one of the best earbuds for calling even when driving bike or cycling.

Controls (5/5) - They have done a good work with the controls, you can do almost everything with the band what you can do with app.

Comfort (3/5) - As I said size could have been smaller and that would have made them more comfortable, also the eartips could have been better.

Battery (5/5) - I think anything with more than 15 hours with fast charging is a good deal.

ANC (5/5) - ANC and transparency work fine, I use Samsung galaxy buds pro so these are as good as them if not better.

App support (5/5) - you can do more things with the app so that's there, and because of that they can push firmware updates and make it even better.

It can connect to 2 devices is the best part, now I can seamlessly watch tv and use phone, without having to connect or disconnect each time.

I think this one has all the things you can ask for 1700 bucks, just have to see how long they will serve me.

So far I am happy because I chose them over oneplus bullets wireless z2.

Will update the review later if I feel to add something or if I face any problems.

UPDATE 1- The headphones are performing better than I expected, the sound is amazing and they can be so loud that you have to listen to them at 50% volume, transparency and ANC are working good too, and you can even feel subtle vibrations in your ear when you are watching an action sequence on tv (which is the best part about my soundcore q20 headphones) and this is the first earphone being able to do that.

Today I used them in heavy rain, it was drizzling dense and they worked just fine.

So only drawback so far is the comfort (I guess my ears would adjust to them in time) and the size which is too big, the magnetic portion could have been round so that they would align perfectly, also the design could have been better by making the edges round rather then edgy but that's how I feel and it depends on personal preference.

Hope this will help you in your purchasing decision.

UPDATE 2- After using it for almost a month I can say that it's a good neckband to buy, let me put cons and prons here.

Prons

1. Good Battery Life (5-10 Minutes of charge gives it a day worth of Juice.) a full charge can last for 2-3 days and I use it heavily.

2. Sound is good, it's loud and Anc is good too.

3. App customization is there and it's good.

4. Bass and loudness is great too, I haven't listened to it on full volume except in heavy traffic.

5. So far haven't had any call quality issues.

6. You can control almost everything with the built in buttons.

7. Best part is 2 device support and it's really seamless to use it with TV and using phone at the same time.

Cons

Comfort could have been better if they had provided better eartips.

Size is a bit bigger for my taste, could have been little compact.

There is a constant delay and distortion of voice while watching you tube videos at 2X. Hope they will fix it with a firmware update."
Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"The fit in the ear, sound quality and build quality and features like noise cancelation are the best in class for this budget. Everyone should buy this one.
But sadly it will stop working suddenly after one year. For me it was so coincidence that it stopped working when realme launched it's new upgrade Realme Buds Wireless 5 ANC."

Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"Ok so this is the review after a day of usage as i will devide this review in parts so I can explain everything...

Battery:- As I said I got this earbuds yesterday and battery percentage was 80% I didn't charge it and used it around 12 hrs but today its showing 30% I am a Heavy user for earbuds but battery is amazing if you charge it once you can easily use this for 3-4 days I am satisfied

Build:- At first glance it looks shiny plastic build but when you hold it in your hands you will feel the qualty and hardness of the earbuds as well as wires. In 1700 the build is great it's justifies the price the buttons are steady and properly working just one issue that after a long time of use I feel slight pain in my left year but may be it is just me. Also these earbuds are very easy to carry in pockets so don't worry the material is very flexible and strong

ANC:- ANC is pretty descent I never used any earbuds before having any ANC features(previously I used Boat Nirvana ION) it's my first time using it and its good I mean in bus or train it will gonna help me to get rid of unwanted sounds to be honest it cuts 30-40% of outside sounds its descent.

Sound Quality:- Guyz TBH The Sound Quality is amazing let me explain it in detail. So vocals are crystal clear no issue in that. The trebles are amazing. I mean when you listen the songs you will gonna notice all kinds of instruments that are used in the music and also all the small small details you will definitely going to hear those too. I mean the sound seperations are just on point in this price. Let's talk about BASS and if you are a BASS lover just buy it. I am a Basshead I love Extra boosted heavy BASS and these earbuds are made for it. Also you can customise the soundtype in app settings so don't worry... overall its best in sound quality I am in love with this earbuds.

App:- As I mentioned earlier that this earbuds supports realme link app which means there are a lots of customizations which you can do in the app such as there are 4 eq modes
1. Vocals: Basically focuses on movie or videos or if you joined classes using this its good.
2.Original sound: In this mode the music will feel flat with no base but clear audio.
3.pure bass: This is the same as original sound but with bass which I am using it will give clear vocals thumpy bass and amazing trebles.
4. Deep Bass: in this mode the Bass will going to takeover the vocals and trebles and all you can feel is Heavy BASS.

There are more features like You can customize the Bass by activating the Bass function, You can turn on ANC, Transperancy or Off the ANC in the app.

Spatial audio: Sometimes it can create a good 3d surround sounds but not everytime so its just 50-50 like watching movies in this mode will give you a good experience.

Game mode without the game mode you can feel the latency but after turning it on the latency reduces if you are a casual gamer and play games for fun I mean daily 2-3 hrs of gameplay just to enjoy with friends and hangout with them you will going to enjoy it but if you are looking for professional gaming this is not the right one for you.

Extras:- it has bluetooth 5.3 and magnetic off and on feature which I am loving in this as soon as you seprate those earbuds it will get connected instantly that's good I have used Boat nirvana ION and I lost the case and I bought this and one thing I can say that this is far better then those the sound quality build features ANC as well as in everything if you are buying it don't think just trust me you never going to regret.... IT'S THE BEST EARBUDS IN MARKET RIGHT NOW!!!!"
Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,Very nice 👍 product. Good sound quality and clarity. good deal with this price. easy to use and good build quality.
boAt Rockerz 255,"Amazing product, it has a great Battery life and charges in a jiffy. Maybe with heavy usage I need to charge it 3 times in a week. Sound is just amazing and the magnetic ear tips to switch off and on is a very very useful and super feature. Pairing is super fast with just a short sound without any voice message. It's great value for money and compatible with any device with dual pairing. The only negative is that the buttons are small due to the size of the device itself"
boAt Rockerz 255,بعد سبع شهور من الاستخدام المنتج ممتاز ... شحن ١٠ دقائق كافي ليومين استخدام .. انصح بإستخدامه وهاشتري واحدة كمان لزوجتي.. شكرا جزيلا
boAt Rockerz 255,"Tinha um fone parecido de outra marca; entretanto, esse fone da boAt é muito melhor em diversos aspectos! O meu fone anterior não tinha um encaixe anatômico perfeito no ouvido; esse é incrivelmente confortável e veda direitinho para diminuir a interferência de ruídos exteriores. A bateria desse fone é surpreendentemente durável; usei quase um dia inteiro com a carga que já veio e tive de carregá-lo apenas no dia posterior. Os graves são perfeitos e o som é límpido e agradável. Espero ter a oportunidade de comprar outros produtos da marca!"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Melhor fone que já tive. Não cai devido ao suporte que fica no pescoço, super confortável, tem uma borracha que entra na orelha que ajuda o fone a ficar no lugar, bateria dura bastante e o carregamento e rápido. O som e ótimo, microfone funciona bem. Vou comprar outro e deixar de reserva."
boAt Rockerz 255,Good
boAt Rockerz 255,"I am an earphone addict. I think I am eligible to write this review. I received it on 21 October and today is 29 October and the battery is still at 50%. I know it's crazyyyyyzzyy. I regret why I didn't bought it sooner. Doesn't have heavenly sound like 50k headphones but it's has Nuclear generated Battery. which you will need to charge only 4to5 times a month.

Bike ride
It's not ideal for bike riding, it's for indoor use, alot of wind noise when riding, but no wind noise when plugged inside the helmet, additionally it makes alot of noise when you touch the earphone wire, the noise is not from the speaker btw

battery
Battery is great, no question about it. It's been 8 day's, I use it everyday and carry it everywhere and still it has 50% battery. after 8 days continuous used.

Sound loudness
The sound is loud I Don't recommend anyone to use it more than 80% level unless you want to lose your hearing within a year. 40% sound level satisfy me. It's too loud. If you put it more than 80% it's too dangerous for the eardrum.

lasting
I Don't expect to last it more than 1 year, like every boat earphone i have bought previously. ( they can last only 1 year maximum which is kind of disappointing.) it's like boat earphone are built to last exactly 1 years. which makes you buy again and again. Which of course makes sense. if they build a earphone that last forever. they won't be able to sell their newly launched product anymore.

look
it looks good when you put it around the neck without listening. but when you put it in your ear it doesn't look cool ( around public) if you want to look cool this is not the right choice for you 😁

Can connect 2 blutooth device at the same time
But the problem is, it can't recognise which is yours and which isn't, so when someone near you turn on their bluetooth, it will directly connect to it. which is kind of a minor problem. but i suppose boat apps can fixed it.

sound quality
sound quality is kind of in the middle, I Don't have complains, but it's far better than 500 rs wired earphone IMO. the bass has high beat sound. mids and treble are perfect for me, bass is too much for me, IDK About your opinion.

Noise block (ANC)

If you play music to 30-40% sound level, you won't hear anyone talking near you. but if you Don't play any music, the noise level is blocked around 10% i would say. Considering this doesn't have any ANC it's great.

i will update after 1,2,3 months used."
boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought 255 Pro+ first and then a year later 255 ANC.

Sound -3/5, Connectivity - 5/5, Battery -6/5 Noise suppression - 3/5, Durability - 2/5

Lasted a year. The sound quality matches the price. The bluetooth connectivity is really good, works across rooms. The fit is perfect, never slips out and feels comfortable to wear for extended periods. The biggest plus is battery life - I use this for my work and have usually two laptops connected to it continuously for 6-8 hours daily and the battery lasts more than a week.
The unexpected con....since last month the silicon coating on the cables around the earpieces has started degrading at an accelerated pace. It is close to snapping but there is no impact on the audio yet. But I will have to replace it soon. Still was worth the money.

255 ANC
Buy this only for the 100 hour battery. ANC doesn't work at all. Also, everything else sucks compared to 255 Pro. Connectivity is bad. Struggles to auto connect and almost never does. Mic picks up a lot of background audio. Earphones are heavier. Just go with 255 pro and save a 1000 bucks."
boAt Rockerz 255,"Looks good, it's loud and good but lacking bass. It's just a general earphone without much features. Also the magnetic buds does not disconnect when both the pods are attached so it's always on, it would be better to save battery when not in use but in this case you need to switch it off."
boAt Rockerz 255,"I like the product, it is a value for money product from boat. I wish boat carry this trend of value for money products.
Pros
Good sound quality, nice bass.
Beast mode is good.
Good build quality

Cons
Buttons are not comfortable. They should be uplifted.
Different colors have different price why?
Ear fitting should improve, as I love ligth weight ear peace.

A ziss sound from neckband, I don't know why?!"
boAt Rockerz 255,"i like the design and quality of the neckband. only i did not like the touch control it would be better if company provide buttons instead of touch control.sometimes they are not working as expected. only for the touch control i am giving 4 star out of 5 ratings.battery life is very good , i have been using this product since last 1 year its durable . sound quality is awesome. its very comfortable to wear and listen songs for long time"
boAt Rockerz 255,"I’ve been using the boAt Rockerz 255 ANC, and honestly, it’s a solid buy. The battery life is unbelievable—100 hours on a full charge! Plus, the quick charge feature is a lifesaver. Got just 10 minutes? You’ll still get 24 hours of playback.

The sound is bass-heavy and clear, perfect for music lovers. ANC works well for drowning out constant background noise, and calls are crystal clear thanks to the 3-mic setup.

On the downside, the sound gets a bit distorted at higher volumes, and the wires feel a little fragile. But for this price, it’s packed with features and definitely worth it!

Verdict: Great value for money, especially if you love long battery life and solid features. Highly recommended!"
boAt Rockerz 255,"I specifically bought this to try this product and found that the middle button says adios amigo and nothing more no idea on how to fix it.

It’s a shady product do not buy this product."
