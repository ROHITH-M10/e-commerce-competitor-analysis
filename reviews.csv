JBL Tune 215BT,"Please do not buy this. Wired earphones worth 700 would give much better audio quality. No bass at all also very high treble kind of tweeter noise. Decided to return the product within the first 15 mins of use.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Not a good one .I have been using it from last couple of months.The sound quality is not good and also speaker volume level keeps decreasing.I want to exchange my device might be something is wrong with this device.

JBL Tune 215BT,"Got it in a deal for 1899/- and here are my thoughts.1. Connectivity and Range: Very Good. It powers on fast and pair easily & quickly, and I can even walk between rooms without any loss in signal or quality.2. Sound:  Decidedly average. It is definitely boosted, so if you do like punchy bass and are not particular about texture or accuracy, no problems. Sound better than almost anything that comes packaged with a smartphone. Distortion creeps in at 65%+ volume3. Usability:  They fit snugly, and isolate just enough so you can hear your music well but also know what's going on in traffic around you.4. Calls: Under normal circumstances these are fine. Person on the other side had some problem hearing me when I've used these while cycling.5. Battery: Good. I use them for about 2-3 hours a day and charge them every 3 days. They charge in a couple of hours and are good to go. Battery lasts for around 5-6hours on an average.Overall: Easy to recommend if you're only looking for an upgrade to generic earbuds and want to try wireless. Battery life and connectivity are great so no issues there. However, if you're primarily looking for a good listening experience, I'd say pass on this one.

JBL Tune 215BT,"Never buy this product...I personally suffer a lot. I have purchazed it on January and its August . Till date its mic got damage 4 times. Every time I have to visit to there customer service office and they took 15 days replacement time i.e totally I have lost 2 month for them. Out of 8 months 2 months this set was in there office. Any they don't bother. Simply stay away from JBL. Wrost product and bad experice overall from service team.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Awesome earphones. Good built quality. Good sound quality. Trustful brand. Good mix function. It takes less than 2 hours to charge actually. Worthy for this price.All the negatives comments out there are dependent on the way they use this product.Overall I love it.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"1. Sound management is bad. Sometimes the headphones are controlled separately by the haptic buttons on it, sometimes by the phone, so if a loud song comes along, it doesn't respond to the phone controls.2. The headphones are not heavy enough to stay on your shoulders while running and that makes it difficult to use them while running.3. Decent sound quality and battery management4. Okay for average use.

JBL Tune 215BT,"Listening to your neighbours blasting bhajan sangeet is a better wireless music experience than buying jbl. I hope God forgives these souls for making these earphones, because I know I can't. I am a JBL fan. I use a lot of their products like their sound bar, flip 4, wired earphones etc. They're all of wonderful quality and excellent durability. I saw that these didn't have a good rating on amazon, but still bought them because I trusted jbl. But as it turns out these are equivalent to cattle - excrement. I've never been so disappointed in something before. I absolutely hated the sound. I thought I'll give it another day and voila, the earphones have the craftsmenship of a toddler's craft from pottery class. The earpiece was coming apart, not to mention how difficult it was to keep them in my ear without falling. Don't buy it. You sure deserve better. I'd wish this whole experience only on the worst of my enemies.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Software :The sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.The bass is very good. Perfect for EDM lovers.The connection range does not extend to another room.Rarely, there are problems with connecting to the device, not a red flag.Hardware:The device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides about, may be a red flag for certain users.The magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.Noise cancellation works very well.Battery life is somewhat poor. The output of a fully charged device is less than 6 hours.Can't say much about durability now as it hasn't been long since I bought it. All I can say is, JBL has much better durability than Skullcandy.Overall:For its price, it's a catch.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Got them for about 2K, and have been using more than a couple of hours each day. Definitely worth the price.Sound quality: Average, but that means it doesn't do anything terribly. The bass isn't as punchy, and the treble could have been more defined. But, there is no noise, so the mids come through clearly (perfect for my choice of music). The volume is a bit lower than wired earphones, but there is no distortion at peak volumes, not that it should be used at those. You could get wired earphones with similar sound quality at abt 1K, so that makes sense, considering that they need to charge for bluetooth hardware.Battery life: Now, this could be done better. Either the should have given a larger battery, or had better battery management software. It doesn't turn off if it is paired, but not used for an extended period. So, you have to make sure that you switch it off manually. Lasts about 4-5 hrs on less than 50% volume.Durability: uses flat wires, and the built ""seems"" sturdy. Definitely better than my Sennheiser earphones.Other features: call quality is decent enough. Mic is not that great, need to be pulled closer for decent performance unless you want to speak up a bit. Buttons are decent, and work without fail. There is a bright LED on the control capsule, lets people know you can't hear them. Wire is a bit too long, could've been a couple of inches shorter each side, but the balance is good. Fit snugly in your ear, doesn't fall out. The earphones bundle up nicely, and take practically no space in your pocket.Overall, given the price, meets my expectations. Wasn't expecting them to match something worth 6K or more, but doesn't disappoint for the money I spent.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Not that much good as expected. Battery life is very much low as compared to other wireless headphones. If you have any other alternative to buy instead of this buy thatSound quality is good only btry life is issue
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"A great buy except that you will not get Google assistant or siri support. Good for bike use too. Not for runners . Good for gym. Best for Bollywood music. As usual JBL sound. Must buy if you are into Bollywood or general youtube and calls user. Calls are also awesome over this headset.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"One of the worst sounding speakers ever I have purchased in my life. Road side ‚Çπ100 speakers sound much much better than this.The audio quality is so tinny, no base, no clarity just distorted pathetic sound.Don‚Äôt u even think of answering your wife‚Äôs call on this one as she might misunderstand u for saying something else as the audio is so poor the other person is always like ‚ÄúSay what now‚Äù...
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Dear Amazon I am dealing with you from very long time but this time I think I get used and defected product because right side ear phone is not working and seal pack was opened I am very disappointed this time I order this device on my friend address so I don't think so I can't change it  and I will not deal with Amazon again.....
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I m a bass lover and reading the reviews i was confused to purchase it or not but i trusted jbl brand and purchased it.Sound quality is good. Bass is sufficient to feel the vibrations and thump. You can purchase this without any 2nd thought
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Sound quality is excellent, connect it any phone you will get the same range of output.. connected to my old honor 4c which has worst earphone output in that phone I was getting best sound output on this JBLT110BT... Talking about the battery it depends on your usage, If you use it continuesly without switching off it would last upto 6 hours... If you use it time by time and turn off in between the running time wouldn't more than 5 hrs. ..The one thing I didn't like about is the length of the cable.. it bit longer for no use and it doesn't fit on your neck for no reason... But still we can compromise that.It would give 4.5 star out of 5..
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I purchased this product a month ago & before to complete its first month, one of the ear-bud stopped working .This was never expected from a brand like JBL !! Amazon return policy gets over within 10 days but then to search for JBL Service Center is a very painful task.JBL has a single Service Center in each city, so very bad 'After-Sale-Service' !! (if you are not lucky)Even after visiting the Service Center, you are asked to submit your defective product & to come-back after 15days to get your product !! (Till the time its time of frustration !!)If possible, please dont go for this Product. Sound quality is also not attractive...
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Writing this review after a year and a half of really rough usage.I have been taking this headphone where ever I go it survived falling down on roads and in the rain ,I have to tell I am really impressed with the build quality and the price was really reasonable.After one year of thrashing and rough usage it finally gave in this week even the charge lasted much longer than usual and charging time was also really less.I would recommend this to anyone due to its superb build quality and long lasting battery.Coming to the sound quality I would give it 5 stars as being a frequent traveler I have no issues and the Bluetooth connectivity is also fast.I wear this earphones inside my helmet and am still able to hear  anything without any problem around traffic.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Product has zero bass ( BASS and TREBBLE are not balanced) , TOTAL WASTAGE OF MONEY .if u are long  time music listner, and like to listen bass , DONT GO FOR IT ,.......Don't know why it's marketed by the name PURE BASS ....it should be sold by name PURE TREBBLE as  BASS is missing from the product.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Bought the product despite some reviews I saw on Amazon that the headphones doesn't produce bass.For me, the product is a good one. Have true pure bass, but only when it is inserted deeply into the ear channel. When the ear plugs are simply kept into the ears, you could hear only treble and no bass.Overall a good product.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Sound quality is just awesome. I bought it as gift for a teenager and he loved it. Also price is good for great product company of JBL.A shorter wire length would have been ideal
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Sound quality is not good & it's to long
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Automatically disconnects after a certain period of time without any kind of notification. The connection also goes off when a phone call comes in and you choose the option to talk without the earphones - after the call ends, you would have to reset the bluetooth connectivity all over again.The sound quality and noise cancellation features are good enough with respect to the price of these earphones.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Didn't even last for a year.Durability is least.The right earpiece broke (Thanks to my nephew)If taken care with proper care might last for 2 years(max).We have two in our house.One had to be replaced again due to non functioning of one side.The other one is the one I'm reviewing.Sound quality was top notch though.Battery backup is decent with 4-5 hours of continuous playback.Charging to 100% takes more than an hour.Verdict- Don't buy this crap, spend some more rupees and get a better quality one.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Got this in Jan 19 and worked very well with excellent excellent quality as expected from JBL. What was not expected is the product lasted just 50 days and all of sudden mic stopped working, - volume button turned hard and could not press. When I tried pressing it the cover flicked off.Contact JBl customer and they were polite enought to guide me to service centre. Reached service centre and surprisingly I was told that there was a physical damage. I told that top cover just flicked when I pressed the volume button little hard. The service centre guy and JBL call centre guys told that it is a use and throw product and under one year it is just replacable. Sincerely with damaged they cannot process the warranty. I think ,  Even a small damage, they will reject the warranty claim. I think they expect the consumer to keep the product intact for a year. Not buying and recommending this anymore
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"sound quality is not good and like trebleNo true bassI have two others JBL T110 and T210 and but this JBL110BT is not that level... it is average quality product...better to purchase from showroom with trial and tested..Finally not happy with this product and initiated for return not for replacement.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Thanks to Amazon.Good sound quality.Bass and treble are well balanced. Perfect sound quality. Best ever I have heard till now. Even better than Sony, which lacks in crystal sound due to overpowered bass.Battery would have been better. But, the battery does not often charge due to some loose connection in the charging unit. I have to drop the full set on the floor thrice, so that the battery regains its charging capacity again.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Very bad performance, hazing sound effect, automatically disconnect from the mobile even between the songs. Had to charge multiple of times. The body is slightly opened. I don't think this peice of garbage is waterproof
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"As usual, there are some connectivity issues. The volume controller's placement is really bad. But it delivers a very good experience. Bass and Treble are perfectly balanced. Midtones and vocals are clear. Most importantly I can use this earphone while riding a 2 wheeler with my helmet on. Araaam see...
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"sound quality rost ...  my expectations is wrong . very bad voice quality ... and call voice  bad
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Thinking JBL is a good brand, available at such a low cost , I bought it. However it was a bad experience. Neither the quality of sound nor the durability matches with the brand level..doubt if Amazon selling fake product..
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I was satisfied with this product and enjoyed using it but after 3 months the left ear piece started lowering the sound. I thought it must be the song quality and nevertheless kept hearing the songs. After about 10 months the sound from left ear piece stopped working all of the sudden. I know its not my mistake since i never used it in moist area not do i take it our during a workout. I have asked Both amazon and the Seller to replace the product for me when the warranty was valid and its been long since then and there's no response from both Amazon and the Seller.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Sounds quality is good.noise cancellation not upto the mark as expected.Battery life is good.The microphone is somewhat placed slightly far, so you need to always pull forward to make sure the opposite person hears or speak louder.And the microphone stopped working completely in only 5 months, with no evident reason.Got it replaced, let's see the life of this now.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Useless product and useless service.. I have purchased this 1 month back.. Now its not working.. And now jbl Harman india compony  are not responding.. Their customer service is not giving any response and also they are not replying of my any mail.. Worst product ever.. Do not buy at any cost even if they are giving u for free..
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Gets disconnected every now and then. Sometimes it's not working with different apps. And there is disturbance in the sound. I asked Amazon to replace my order as it was in warranty period but they asked me to go to a JBL outlet. As I moved to different location it's very difficult because they don't have a showroom here.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"If you don't care about sound quality and noise isolation, go ahead and buy these as they are built extremely well. Sound quality though, I regret buying these.My forst and Probably my last JBL product.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Eventing is working fine. Except there is no service center in pune. I need to send it to Mumbai for replacement.. they also didn't accept the courier.. after 6 months left side of my headphone is dead. I send it to my cousine to replace it. On same day I've got the replacement. The service is very good.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I'm fed up with this Bluetooth earphone. JBL India has only one service centre in the country. I have couriered the earphone to the service centre located in Gurgaon, Haryana. And no response from the service centre. Really sad about the product.No service Available since the right hand side of the earphone stopped working. Not worth for money. Very low sound quality. Just good design only. Bad and not good enough. ‚Çπ2099 is extremely high for this. Better to sell for ‚Çπ500.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Am a regular user of JBL brand ear phones used more than 5models. Iam totally happy with this product easy to access and great battery life. Sound quality is good and great noise cancellation. Easily fitting in ears. Material used for the product is good.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Worst product from jbl . It doesn‚Äôt sound good. Though it is jbl‚Äôs Bass model of wireless Bluetooth but useless, no bass at all been feel. And it looks like local product. So this product is absolutely not value for money.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"The sound quality and noise cancellation both are good but I bought it two months back and this is the second time I got it replaced because it stopped working...JBL service is pathetic...they take their own sweet time(12-15days) to return the product.Also there is just a single JBL service center available in every city so it is a task to get it replaced if you live away from the center.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Did not expect this kind of service from JBL and AMAZON too. Fake reviews. Durability is too poor. One side earphone speaker stopped working in just 2 months and i wrote to jbl. No action taken. Amazon also dont have any option for replacement when the product is in warranty.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Great wireless earphones. Used it at the gym, while driving and at office. Music sounds great and voice calls are good too. Don't go with the negative reviews. I don't know what people need out of an earphone. Good earphones and is solves  the purpose. Went with jbl at the back of my charge 2+ Bluetooth speakers.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,">>Durability is the best thing about this product.>>Bluetooth connectivity is fast & easy. The range of  bluetooth is also good.>>Sound quality is fine, but the amount of bass is not  really good. So, if you are a bass lover then this might  not be a good option for you.>>Battery backup is not really 6 hours if you are  continuously listening to the music.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Worst earphone I have ever seen, price is too much for this earphone after checking for two days I m returning this product. Price range should be 200-400 for this earphone.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Value for money ... felt something missing after all....  don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs missing ... frequencies /sound quality or I don‚Äôt know ... I didn‚Äôt get full satisafaction ... brands make cheaper prodcts to have less quality than premium... don‚Äôt know ...
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I bought this as a gift for someone. It's got amazing sound quality. The bass isn't as heavy as I thought it would be. But I prefer it that way. Don't expect drum bursting bass. But it gets the job done for the price your paying.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"The Product worked for really well for 2 Months, but post which the Product battery life is pathetic even after a sufficient amount of charge is done. I would like to return this product or opt for a buyback. Trust on JBL is blemishing. Hopefully management shall look into this and do the needful. Else I might have to look for a different solution.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"The quality of the product  is not good cos right side head phone is not working before reaching a month.and i am not satisfy with your service and do proper action regarding headset or else i am going to recommend or suggest my friends to not purchase a product of your company.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I bought this after my motorola verve loop plus stopped working. The sound quality is good with average battery life. Thr left earpiece stopped working after 2-3 days of use so returned.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I like this earphones, preety fashionable and high quality sound but one day this earphone got dropped from me and this lead to defect in their magnets and sounds quality.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"The sound quality isn't as good as jbl should have. The comnectivity too could have been better. For calls,u need to be near the mouth piece.so a better product can be researched in market
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Not for Bass lovers. I am not even one, but still would prefer a bit more bass. Also, it's not so comfortable to wear or stay on place if you would jog or run. It's annoying to keep adjusting, which otherwise a wired headset will be better.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"2 months after purchasing the earphones, the left speaker's sound subsided. And not long after the right side went off completely.Sound isn't too bad but I wouldn't call it greatWas highly disappointed by the earphones after spending so much on something that didn't even last 6 months
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Its not too useful, there are better options available from other companies like boat. Plus the blue light continuously is lit. It kind of is a negative point.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"It seems good but...I am facing issue of Bluetooth connectivity...When i connect my phone to earphone ... And i go from 1 room to other room.... It gives me problems...

"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Poor built quality. Right side stopped working just 11 day after purchase. Not even able to return as 10 days past. Now need to get help of service center. Not sure if this issue will be fixed. Invested 2000rs and product stopped working within 11 days. Also when i use this for calls, the other side person struggles to hear my voice.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Battery degrades faster than expected since it does not hold charge for as long as it once used to (bought it less than 9 months ago and use it 3-4 times a week)Sound quality is good but don't recommend to use with an iPhone (especially for playing PUBG)
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"The device creates a horrible sound when mic is on while playing games like PUBG on mobile. Also, sometimes it is getting lots of voice cut during playing songs. Sound quality is ok.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Works perfectly fine unlike reviews. Easy to configure. Long battery life. Total noise cancellation. Try 3d or 8d music tracks to enjoy real experience

"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Guys please don't buy. Had to have it replaced in flat 2 days of usage as one side stopped giving out the sound. Fortunately happened within 5 days of usage else had to simply discard it. Isn't worth for the price. Trust me the ones we get outside Railway stations are better with definitely a much better durability.Criminal loss of 2K
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"So it was good at first....i mean the bass could have been better but still as compared to other Bluetooth earphones its one of the best....But particularly the product i recieved have stopped charging anymore.... So really disappointed. I hope someone can tell me what to do next. Sadly returning window is closed as well
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"The one i got, had pathetic  battery life.... its so hard to find a service centre... ended up lying in my drawer for a year.. was not able to find the contact of jbl store for service..

"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Poor Sound Quality. Leaf Sport has a much better sound quality than this and it is half of it's price.Battery backup is good but you can get much better battery backup in boat wireless.Durability is less compared to boat.So i would recomment boat over JBL.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Excellent sound quality. Gets disconnected from music or video to phone speaker if there is any notification.Background noise cancellation is not available , rather , it picks more on the background noise rather than reducing the same. Same issue in two different pieces.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"It is Good earphones (Wireless Type) and has a good amount of Bass delivery. But in-built mic is not so good when you are travelling. Some time it gets disconnected. Overall I will give it a 4 Star.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Good speakers ,. Clean sound
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Sound quality and battery life is good. But wire is too long, that holding of ear phone in ear is poor. It bacame out from ear by its own weight of earphone on movement of body or on gyming, running. Not good for gyming.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Using the headphones for last 6 months. Now the right earpiece has stopped working. It picks up a lot of surrounding noise, to such a level that the other person is not able to hear you voice. Sound quality is average. Causes voice distortion when wifi and Bluetooth both are connected.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Baught same set of earphones from abroad same model no n what not. Real cheap quality product compared to that one. Sound quality is bad build quality is worse.either vendor is selling 1st copies in d name of origional or JBL is offering cheap quality products in INDIA.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Good purchase but not recommended for runners. Better for training in gym as the controls on either side are heavy and slide the buds out of your ears
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"If you are addicted to music then this earphone will end your addiction, no bass at all, at more than 60% very irritating treble, sound quality below average. And no returns,only replacement available.i don't understand why some people saying that they have good bass

"
JBL Tune 215BT,"I bought this product ten days back and it's stopped working . Despite charging, the earphones don't get powered on after pressing the button. In four months, this product has given away it's most critical feature. Request the vendor to take necessary action to resolve this issue

JBL Tune 215BT,"This product last just for 1 year ... not even 1 year. Last year on Feb 15 i received this product. Today is 4th Feb 2019 and the left earpiece is gone. The indicators light went off on the 6th month.. but i still did not returned the product and thatvwas the mistake i made..
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Sound quality is as expected as JBL brand should be...crystal clear & bass is also superb... but I am a little bit disappointed with the battery back up.. company said about 6~7 hours of battery life... but in actual you can actualy use it upto ~4 hours maximum at a stress..
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Sound quality is balanced and good. Don't expect much of bass, but the amount of bass you get is sufficient. Battery life is almost 4-5 hrs once charged to 100%
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Worst product please do not but , call has many glitches !
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Nice Product in the price range, good sound quality, decent battery life only issue is size of in-ear buds, these are little bigger so in longer use it start paining in the year.

JBL Tune 215BT,"Was expecting good sound quality but it turns out to be trash.I am a owner of jbl flip 4 with is probably the best wireless speaker in it's price range so I was expecting these to be equally good but these sound avrage and definitely did not meet my expectations.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Good built quality.Poor sound quality, roadside headphones sounds better than this or it's not match my expectations.Company mentioned on box ""pure bass"" but i would say ""Poor Bass"" either No Bass.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Pros:-Sounds pretty good yes bass is there but don't expect it to blow your ears. And battery life is on higher side lasts 5 hours easily with volume being at 80%. Build quality is good. Cons:- the length of the wire is more JBL should have decreased it.
"
JBL Tune 215BT,"Do not buy any item marking JBL, some are fake China products. But buy this one. It confirmed genuine.
"

Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"just go for it. Highly recommend product. Better than any bluetooth earphones I have tried even at double the price. Better than original level U, Tagg inferno . Samsung says battery is 10 hours, I get 12 hours. Range is commemdable. Around 40mtrs easily. Looks good. Sounds good. Dual drivers, expected nothing less. only con is, the. wires are a bit on thinner side. But Samsung warranty policy is nice. They just replace your product with a new one.
"
Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth. Please try out something else other than this. This product is only for people who have money to burn without expecting any returns.

Comfy piece, yes It takes 2 3 days to get comfy with ear piece as it is heavy & big but one can get familiar with it very soon. Only draw point is earpiece cable robustness. Very thin & breakable cable used for both ear piece. It may get broken on very slight pull. Please be careful. Else excellent.

Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work

Connects 2 devices at a timeHowever after a few weeks use, I found That battery indicator is total waste. It may Show 100% once then suddenly drop yo 55% N then Keep steady at 55% N suddenly 0.

"
Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"I have purchased u flex from Croma and purchased another from reliance digital showroom. Whether it a a voice call or music, this is top rated bluetooth headphone. Samsung branding and premium quality looks is an add on. It works best with S8 and note8 above models (Dolby atmos) and it has a dedicated app for sound effects.The most important advice I would like to give u all is don't buy from Amazon or any other online websites. Croma / Reliance digital / Samsung showrooms are the only official sellers of this product.
"
Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App, one can customize options like Vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

Realme Buds Wireless 3 Neo,"Audio started getting distorted in left earpiece by third week of purchase.

Oneplus Bullets Z2,"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

Oneplus Bullets Z2,"This is my first purchase from this company...so I was a bit hesitant...but I must say...these are the best in its class... bought it for my husband...sound quality is very good and magnet in ear plugs makes it very easy to stay around neck...only setback is...I m unable to fit those extra rubber covers on it...because they both seem to be for left ear only. Well...that's not a big issue...will soon find a way out ..I hope so... overall....these are worth...go for it.

"
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

"
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"The product is surprisingly good. I thought at this price the functioning Will be basic. But they have included volume keys too. Audio quality and noise cancellation is also satisfactory. But the battery backup is very low. I'm only getting around 2.5 hrs backup while using calls. Also it starts saying ""Low battery!! Please charge!!"" once the charge is below 20% repeatedly making it literally unusable
"
Oneplus Bullets Z2,"These are excellent bluetooth earphones as expected! The sound is clear with  music , videos and phone calls. The caller can be heard very clearly as well as the caller can hear me with no disturbances. Also along with these ear - plugs are so that the chances of sliping reduces. It is best for  travelling as it is bluetooth earphones. Along with this you will be getting charging wire and main benefit is that you will be getting 1 year warranty with itüòçüòçüòç

boAt Rockerz 255,"No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

boAt Rockerz 255,"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

"
boAt Rockerz 255,"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted.
"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible
"
boAt Rockerz 255,"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

Big Suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS

boAt Rockerz 255,"Awesome bass. This is even at low volume. So if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. Really like the sound. There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.Spent 999 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it.
"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I‚Äôm writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.‚Ä¢ The sound is nothing great, it‚Äôs a bit on the bassy side. If you‚Äôre a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.‚Ä¢ Connectivity is quick and painless ‚Äì and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I‚Äôm walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it‚Äôs the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone‚Äôs in my jeans.‚Ä¢ Battery life is nothing to write home about ‚Äì I listen to music constantly even when I‚Äôm at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.‚Ä¢ It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs got great build quality for the price ‚Äì looks and feels premium. Doesn‚Äôt tangle at all.‚Ä¢ It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

boAt Rockerz 255,"Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

boAt Rockerz 255,"Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

boAt Rockerz 255,"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.

boAt Rockerz 255,"Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.

boAt Rockerz 255,"The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

boAt Rockerz 255,"Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

boAt Rockerz 255,"I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is good. noise cancellation is not upto the mark. battery quality is decent. by charging it once you can enjoy upto 5hrs of music without any issue

boAt Rockerz 255,"Awesome best budget wireless earphones
"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn't liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it.
"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Got this for Rs. 999. A great deal for the price.Bought it socially for multipoint features.Works great with 2 mobiles but I have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a Windows 10 laptop. It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.Battery is okay. Can't take it off the whole day.Don't expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass. Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.

boAt Rockerz 255,"Pros:charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous)two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs,in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type).using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.Gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).Lightwight,good build quality.i replaced rubber earplugs with piston earphone plugs, the 3 pairs comes with package are not too soft but are fine.you can control volume of pc and mobile depends on which device is currently playing.i am using piston onemore ,music quality is not to that level but is pretty decent. bass is balancedcons:Range is 10m in real world plays well if u are in room , the moment you walk out of room then distortion occurs.mic is very sensitive and works fine so far no complains from other end. i have not used outside the room.when it keep it for charging it gets switch off on it own then have to reconnect it again (not a big issue) ....first i had doubt on it battery,sound quality,mic quality but after using it i am happy even though i have used one more ,boat 255,mi earphone 399 , Samsung earphone, Phillips 249 etc.

boAt Rockerz 255,"I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

boAt Rockerz 255,"Worst product
"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Nice product. I love it's sound and bass. I purchased for me and another two for my family members after I make sure for it's sound quality. But one thing I really concerned here about it build quality. Mine replaced for two times till now for it's power button issue. It will take 20 days to replace the product. First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. Now they clame this new replacement is a good one. Let's see how many days it will again goes.
